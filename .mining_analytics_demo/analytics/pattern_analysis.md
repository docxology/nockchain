# Log Pattern Analysis

## Identified Patterns

### High-Frequency Patterns
1. **Hash Rate Updates**: Regular hash rate reporting every 30 seconds
2. **Network Status**: Peer connection status updates
3. **Memory Monitoring**: Resource usage tracking
4. **Mining Operations**: Block attempt logging

### Error Patterns
No significant error patterns detected

### Performance Patterns
- Hash rate stability: 95.2%
- Memory usage trend: Gradually increasing
- CPU utilization: Consistent with expected load
- Network connectivity: Stable

### Anomaly Detection
- No critical anomalies detected
- Minor variations in hash rate within normal range
- Memory usage trending upward (monitor for leaks)
- Network latency spikes: 2 occurrences

## Pattern-Based Recommendations
1. **Monitoring**: Continue current logging frequency
2. **Alerting**: Set thresholds for hash rate drops > 20%
3. **Resource Management**: Implement memory usage caps
4. **Network Optimization**: Monitor peer connection quality
